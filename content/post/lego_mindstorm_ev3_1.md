Ruwan and I spend a lot of time together in Starbucks before his defense. He shared his experience s with 3D printer and all other cool stuff he does at home. I visited his home recently and was amazed by his works. His wife also entertained me with the delicious tea.  He suggested starting with Lego Mindstorm ev3 as it has nice programming experience module. I bought the toolkit on that day. Recently, Minal and I started exploring ev3 drop and drag programming experience. It took almost 2 days 2 hours a day to build the first bot you see in the picture. Then we started exploring motor control, looping structure, and many other structures provided for programming.  I plan to explore ev3 python programming module to perform the same control. So far, it has been a cool and enjoyable experience.
