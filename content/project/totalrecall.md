Total Recall is an important task in supervised text mining. The objective of this task is to find everything about an entity or about a research question. For example, in Technology assisted review (TAR), the objective is to find all the documents relevant to a request for production in a legal matter, whereas, Systematic Review (SR) involves formulating a research question, searching in multiple biomedical databases, identifying relevant Randomized  Control Trails (RCTs) based on abstracts and titles (abstract screening) and then based on full texts of a subset thereof, assessing their methodological qualities, extracting different data elements  and synthesize them, and finally reporting the conclusions on a particular review question. The first step in this process is to browse a large collection of abstracts and label them as relevant or non-relevant for the given research question. However, abstract screening is a cumbersome process, and thus a sophisticated methods to solve the problem is of great importance.
